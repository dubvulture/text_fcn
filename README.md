## TextFCN 

**Text Detection** in natural images using a *Fully Convolutional Network* developed during my Stage experience for my Computer Science B.Sc thesis.

*Spaghetti code warning*. I do not expect anyone to try and run this so:

1. If you're looking for a maintainable and easily deployable FCN implementation, please refer to [TensorFCN](https://github.com/dubvulture/tensor_fcn).
2. If you **really** want to go through all of this, please refer to Chapter 4 of my [thesis](https://github.com/dubvulture/thesis) and/or take a look at the code of all the [dataset readers](https://github.com/dubvulture/text_fcn/tree/master/text_fcn/dataset_reader) and the [final stages](https://github.com/dubvulture/text_fcn/tree/master/text_fcn/pipes) for bounding boxes extraction for each ICDAR competition submission.
